# Park4You - A Parking Rental Application
This days, parking spots are harder and harder to find. We, the Park4You team, wish to change that. By using our app users can park their cars in the easiest way possible. Users can search for available parking in a certain area and rent it for the time they wish for. In addition, users can rent out their own parking, in their own conditions, such as time, cost and more.

This project is developed as a part of "Software Engineering" course by Eran Katz, Itzik Ben Shushan and Gal Cohen.
